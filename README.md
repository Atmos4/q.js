# q.js

`q.js` is a tiny jQuery alternative. It is 465 bytes minified and 299 bytes gzipped.

## Browser support

Supports every browser above IE9+. That should mean every browser.

## Install locally

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Credits

The library's syntax is inspired by jQuery.

The implementation improves on a lot of ideas from [ki.js](https://github.com/dciccale/ki.js/). Go and give him a star!
